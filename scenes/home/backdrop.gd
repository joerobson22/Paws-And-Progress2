extends Control
## The view behind every home screen: a forest seen from a hilltop, in
## layers (art/home/backdrop.tscn, which you can edit). It follows the real
## time of day: the day sky by day and the starry one by night, crossfading
## over a twilight of about 40 minutes round sunrise and sunset, with the
## layers dimming to Night Brightness. The sun and moon cross the sky as in
## the walk (DayCycle). There's only ever one: it stays put as you slide
## between screens, its layers panning by their parallax (near ones further
## than far ones), and the ground runs on below the hilltop when you look
## down. A full-screen flow (choosing a focus, a walk) covers it, so it stops
## drawing until that closes. A wash of the app's background colour mutes it
## so the screen reads on top.
## A holiday dresses it up (its HolidayLook): pictures swapped for others
## (dead forests at Halloween), snow on everything, decorations laid on its
## layers (its home_scene: pumpkins, eggs, lights in the trees), snow
## falling or fireworks in the sky.
