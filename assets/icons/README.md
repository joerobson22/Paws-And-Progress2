# Icons

Every icon in the app is an SVG file here, named `<name>.svg`. Edit one, or
swap it for your own, and the app picks it up next time it runs.

## Drawing an icon

- Draw on a **24 x 24** canvas (keep `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`).
- Use **one colour**, any colour. The app recolours it to fit each place
  it's used (white on a green button, grey when locked, and so on), keeping
  only the shape and its soft edges.
- Lines are 2.2 wide with round ends. A few buttons ask for bolder lines.
  Those swap `stroke-width="2.2"` for their own width, so keep that exact
  text on lines that should follow them.
- Leave a little room at the edges, like the icons already here.
- Keep the `.svg.import` file next to each icon. It tells Godot to ship the
  file as it is (importer `keep`), so the app can read and recolour it.

## Full-colour pictures (drawn as they are)

These are optional. Without them the app uses the one-colour icon.

| File | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| `achievements/<achievement id>.svg` | An hours or gifts achievement's medal, instead of its icon. It's faded until earned. Ids are in `data/achievements.json` (hours) and `all_gifts`. |
| `art/places/<place id>.png` (in `art/`) | A place's button picture, white on transparent. See `art/README.md`. |
